## About

Voxnostra is an independent platform where members of civil society, independent organizations and persons can track and report on the progress of public projects or contracts making accountability of public projects execution transparent and open to the taxpayer.  Individuals can report on the status of projects and equally have a live update on the level of execution of each project. With the help of civil society organizations, anti-corruption organizations, ministry of public contracts and volunteering individuals different public  projects or contracts will be uploaded to the platform together with roadmaps and financial plans or budget.

## Why

In Cameroon many development projects either remain on paper, executed poorly or end mid-way execution, funds are allocated for these projects. The failure of public projects slows down the development of the country and many times with no accountability to the tax payer. Most projects fail due to misappropriation of public funds by government officials, award ofcontracts to incompetent contracting companies as a result of bribery and corruption or nobackgound checks just to name a few. Most at times the taxpayer has little knowledge of theexistence, state of execution and financials of these public projects.

## Usage



## Setup

Install `npm` or `yarn` if you dont have any of them already installed. We recommend Yarn though.

After clonning the repo to your local machine and moving into the cloned folder, Run `yarn install` to get started by installing dependencies. 

Run `npm run dev` . This starts the development server on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view application.

#### Hints

- Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to get started. We'll assume you are using Yarn.
- Install additional dependencies: `yarn add <dependency-name> [-D]`
- Run tests: `yarn test`
- Run tests with test coverage info: `yarn test:cover`
- Check the codebase for proper syntax and formatting compliance: `yarn lint`
- Run your app in local dev mode: `yarn start`. This puts the bundled app in a `dist` folder, set up a local web server at localhost:1234, and continues to watch for your code changes which it syncs with the local server. This means if you loaded the app in a browser, it will auto-refresh as you code along. Feel free to use whatever bundler best meets your needs. Parcel was only added as a sample and for those looking for a simple but effective solution to the hassle of bundlers.

## Contributing
If this project sounds interesting to you and you'd like to contribute, thank you!
First, you can send a mail to buildforsdg@andela.com to indicate your interest, why you'd like to support and what forms of support you can bring to the table, but here are areas we think we'd need the most help in this project :
1.  area one (e.g this app is about human trafficking and you need feedback on your roadmap and feature list from the private sector / NGOs)
2.  area two (e.g you want people to opt-in and try using your staging app at staging.project-name.com and report any bugs via a form)
3.  area three (e.g here is the zoom link to our end-of sprint webinar, join and provide feedback as a stakeholder if you can)
